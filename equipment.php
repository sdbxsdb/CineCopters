    <div class="col rhs">On a budget or on a recce we have a fleet of smaller drones to suit every need. Our Mavic 2 Pro packs a powerful punch with its Hasselblad 1" sensored camera shooting 100mbs up to 4K in LOG.<br><br>

      Having a drone with you on a recce is not necessarily a must but it always helps.  Our pocket sized (literally) Mavic Mini
      allows the director, cinematographer and locations department to see the lay of the land and gauge what will been visible from the air on the day. <br><br>
      From a creative point of view it's also a great opportunity to allow us to dial in a shot to hit the ground running on shoot day.<br><br>
