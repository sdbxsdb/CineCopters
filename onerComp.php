                <p>Called a <strong>"long take"</strong>, this is one very long, uninterrupted camera shot. The camera moves, the actors move, things happen, the camera keeps shooting. Difficult. Expensive. Rarely makes it out of the editing room intact but if done correctly leaves viewers wondering "wow.. how tf did they do that?" </p>

            <h2>What you need to do</h2>
            <p>Come up with a shot / scene that can be done in one continuous take using a drone as a handheld gimbal AND a flying platform. <br><br>
                The shot can be as long as you want within reason and can start in the air, transfer to the ground and the fly back in the air or vice versa but it must have 2 transitions.<br><br>
                <hr> Up -> Down -> Up <br>OR <br>Down -> Up -> Down
                <hr>

                <br><br>
                Email us your idea with the subject line "Let's do a oner" in as much detail as possible including location(s). Storyboards no matter how rough are always helpful but not required.<br><br>

                The winner will get the same CineCopters crew that provided the drone filming for the likes of:<br><br>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; font-weight: bold;">
                <li>Ridley Scott's - The Last Duel</li>
                <li>Stephen Spielbergs - The Turning</li>
                <li>Line of Duty 6</li>
                <li>Bloodlands</li>
                <li>Pixie</li>
                <li>Into the Badlands</li>
                <li>Mercedes, LandRover, Toyota, Ford car commercials</li>
                <li>and countless others</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>

            <p>Please keep in mind that although it might make a spectacular shot to fly up a city street or along side a car these types of shots often require extra permissions to carry out legally depending on drone height - this can often incur extra expense to have traffic and public control. <br><br>This should in no means put you off an epic shot but we recommend that you plan a shot / scene that is within in your capabilities to organise safely and legally.  If you have any questions about feasibility or legality please get in touch before submitting.</p>
