Having worked with them all around the country over the past 5 years, on all kinds of productions, their calm and professional approach is second to none. The footage they deliver is always above and beyond what the director is looking for. We were really impressed by the high standard of service, professionalism, and superb quality of the footage.”</p>

            <p class="card-text">“I cannot speak more highly of CineCopters approach to filming... Communication between BBC production and their crew was excellent throughout; they worked just as happily overseen by our director as independently to a brief... Absolutely stunning (the opening shots of the show are to die for). Having worked with over a dozen drone and ground crews in the last few years I can confidently say they are at the top of their game and recommend them to anyone looking for first class company in Ireland...”</p>

            <p class="card-text">Season 3 of Into the Badlands required extensive drone work. Cinecopters covered every day we required on a multi unit shoot, often at late notice due to our ever changing schedule. We used both lightweight and heavy lift drones all of which were operated with great skill, professionalism but in a relaxed no fuss fashion by the lads at Cinecopters. We would not have been able to show the epic landscapes and expand the world of the Badlands without them”</p>
