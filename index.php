Cinecopters covered every day we required on a multi unit shoot, often at late notice due to our ever changing schedule. We used both lightweight and heavy lift drones all of which were operated with great skill, professionalism but in a relaxed no fuss fashion by the lads at Cinecopters. <br><br>We would not have been able to show the epic landscapes and expand the world of the Badlands without them”</p>
